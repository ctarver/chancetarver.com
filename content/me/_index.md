## Extended Bio.
I grew up in SW Louisiana and attended Sulphur High School. 
After high school, I went to Louisiana Tech University where I majored in Math and Electrical Engineering.
I then went to Rice University to pursue my PhD in ECE under Dr. Joseph R. Cavallaro.

My wonderful wife, [Jennifer Pearson](https://jenniferpearsonlmsw.com/), and I have been married since 2020. We enjoy spending time traveling around the country to explore great coffee shops and hikes.
