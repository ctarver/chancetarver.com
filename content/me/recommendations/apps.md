Below are some of my favorite apps. Try them out and see if they help you too!

### Obsidian
I discovered Obsidian after using Roam Research. I eventually left Roam in favor of the local markdown files. 


### Readwise
[Readwise](https://readwise.io/) collects all of your highlights from Kindle, Pocket, etc. in one place and provides a daily review. It also will export your highlights to another service such as Roam. This app was one that instantly became part of my workflow, and I highly recommend it. 

### Todoist
[Todoist](https://www.todoist.com/) is my TODO app of choice! There are endless todo apps out there for endless styles of productivity. This one has been the one to vibe best with me. I particularly like the natural language entry of due dates and the Google Calendar sync. 

### Radarscope
It is amazing to me how bad radar looks in most weather apps. Do yourself a favor and get [Radarscope](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.basevelocity.radarscope&hl=en_US&gl=US&pli=1).
