### Aspen
My wife and I went to Aspen for our honeymoon. We skied a little bit, but it wasn't for us. Overall, the vibes of staying in a nice hotel while it snowed outside were top notch. 

### Houston 
I went to grad school in Houston and frequently visit for family. Below are my recommendations:
#### Local Foods
Get the crunchy chicken sandwich. 
#### Star Pizza
The lunch buffet was one of my favorite lunches :)
